## Operating Systems
- [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) - The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application
- [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) - The Yocto Project (YP) is an open source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems regardless of the hardware architecture. The project provides a flexible set of tools and a space where embedded developers worldwide can share technologies, software stacks, configurations, and best practices that can be used to create tailored Linux images for embedded and IOT devices, or anywhere a customized Linux OS is needed

## Return Oriented Programming 
- [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) - This tool lets you search your gadgets on your binaries to facilitate your ROP exploitation. ROPgadget supports ELF/PE/Mach-O/Raw formats on x86, x64, ARM, ARM64, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, RISC-V 64, and RISC-V Compressed architectures
- [Ropper](https://github.com/sashs/ropper) - Display information about files in different file formats and find gadgets to build rop chains for different architectures (x86/x86_64, ARM/ARM64, MIPS, PowerPC, SPARC64)

## Data Integrity and Security
- dm-verity
- fs-verity

- fscrypt
Filesystem level
CONFIG_ECRYPT_FS (ecryptfs stacking filesystem)
CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION (fscrypt)
built into ext4, F2FS, UBIFS
user-space tools for embedded systems at https://github.com/google/fscryptctl;

Filesystem binding
Linux containers
Linux cgroups and namespaces

## Hardening Yocto

## Linux Security Modules

Sanitizers
Complexity analysis

## Linux firewalls
- IPtables
- Nftables

## Access control models
- Discretionary (DAC)
- Mandatory (MAC)
- Role-Based (RBAC)

Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel Support (SMACK) [CONFIG_SECURITY_SMACK] - MAC system using labels. Labels on objects are required to match task labels
TOMOYO [CONFIG_SECURITY_TOMOYO] - MAC with process monitoring. Not well maintained
AppArmor [CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR]- MAC-like with task profiles. Tasks without profiles run with normal Linux DAC permissions.
Yama [CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA] - Adds ptrace restrictions
Lockdown [CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM] - Enforces coarse lockdown
SELinux [CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX] - MAC. Heavyweight and more appropriate for PCs
LoadPin [CONFIG_SECURITY_LOADPIN] - Ensures all kernel-loaded files (modules, firmware) all originate from same (verified, ro) filesystem
Landlock [CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK] - Provides sandbox access control of kernel objects


## Lockdown prevents access to a running kernel image
The following are disabled/restricted:
/dev/mem, /dev/kmem,/dev/kcore,/dev/ioports
BPF
kprobes
debugfs
Kernel modules must be signed or IMA appraised

IMA requires "secure_boot" rules to the policy

## Static Analysis
